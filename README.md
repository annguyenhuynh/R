* **Problem** : Before the pandemic, the company experienced an increasing rate of employee departures. Employee attrition is a challenge to a tech company as certain skills are needed to ensure quality products and smooth operations. Hence, we are looking at multiple factors from the HR dataset and attempting to find the correlation between those factors and the leaving company status to discover which ones contribute to employees’ quitting.

* **Summary**: This dataset has 13 variables and 1100 observations. The variables consist of leaving status, salary, commuting distance, job levels, departments, weekly hours, frequency of business travel, years at the company, years since promotion, job satisfaction, performance ratings, and marital status.
  
* **Analyses summary**: In this analysis report, we examine the relationship between leaving and six other factors - salary, commuting distance, job satisfaction, performance ratings, weekly hours, and frequency of business travel. Among the six factors, salary, performance ratings, and working hours per week are strong indicators for leaving. Interestingly, the data also show that sales and product development departments have the highest turnover rates.

* **Methods**: This report comprise of summary tables and data visualizations. Main packages used in this project include: ‘readxl’ to import .xlsx file into R; ‘dplyr’ for pipe operating; ‘ggplot2’ for data visualization; and ‘skimr’ to skim through data.
